## Setup Local Environment

‚ö†Ô∏è **Please Note:** Docker is required to run LeetConnect locally. Ensure that you have Docker installed on your system before proceeding with the following steps.

1.  Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

2.  Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/LeetConnect.git
    ```

3.  Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory based on the provided `.env.example` file. You can copy the example file and customize it as needed.

4.  To start the development server make sure you're in the root directory of the project and run the following command

        ```
        npm start
        ```

    -   The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5001.
    -   The backend will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

### Extension Development

If you want to test the extension locally, follow these steps:

1. In the root folder, build the extension:

    ```
    npm run build
    ```

2. Upload the `dist` directory created in the `extension-ui` directory to your browser's extensions.

3. Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the `dist` directory. This step should be done only once during the initial setup.

Whenever you make changes to the extension, run the `npm run build` command again to reflect the changes in the extension.

These instructions allow you to set up both the backend and frontend locally, as well as test the extension in your browser. Make sure to create the `.env` file for the backend and customize it as needed for your local environment.

## Getting Started With Contributing

    ```

2. Create a new branch for your contribution. Replace `feature-name` with a descriptive branch name:

    ```
    git checkout -b feature-name
    ```

3. Start making your changes and contributions.
